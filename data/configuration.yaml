# output phases for outpost production
# each phase is list of maps from an item name (or alias) to the number of items to keep on hand
# (exported amounts are handled automatically and in addition to the on-hand stockpile)
# phases are cumulative (e.g. Phase 2 automatically also includes all items from Phase 1)
